# STC Churn Analysis Project
## Overview  
This project simulates a real-world churn analysis for a telecom company modeled after **STC (Saudi Telecom Company)**. The goal is to uncover patterns in customer behavior and provide actionable recommendations to reduce churn and improve retention.

## Objective  
Telecom companies lose significant revenue from customer churn, especially among **prepaid** and **short-tenure** users. This analysis investigates those patterns using a fictional dataset.

## Key Insights  
- **Prepaid users** are far more likely to churn than postpaid users.  
- **Short-tenure customers** (under 6 months) have the highest churn risk.  
- **Postpaid users with longer tenure** show stronger loyalty.

## Recommendation  
Introduce or expand **contract-based subscription plans** targeted at new/prepaid users. This could improve early-stage retention and long-term customer value.

## Tools Used  
- Google Sheets  
- Pivot Tables  
- Pie Charts  
- COUNTIF logic for churn summaries

## Files  
- `stc_churn_analysis.xlsx`: Dataset + analysis + charts

## Disclaimer  
The dataset is **fictional** and was created for educational and demonstration purposes only. It is not based on actual STC customer data.
